### root context to separate project - imadethis
unfortunately, ./tmp/imadethis setup to install to a subfolder,
making it hard to remote git push to a plain root.
Plain root necessary for SEO on 'lern2code' subdomain so
it consists merely of ./index.html to push to remote,
supplying root that stands above ./imadethis code project.
